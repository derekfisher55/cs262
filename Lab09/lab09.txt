How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented?
  Hello.java supports a GET method and PlayerResource.java supports GET, PUT, POST,
  and DELETE.

PlayerResource.java
  What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?
    Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
  Compare and contrast the following:
    SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects
      An SQL query is used to manipulate the database data, while JDBC statements
      are used to manipulate the Java code.
    SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
      SQL relations is a table that has built-in relations, while JDBC result sets
      is similar to a table, but can only manipulate one row at a time. List<Player>
      is the most different since there are no built-in relations with its elements.
  Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?
    This function returns a string from a table, unless it doesn't exist. In that
    case the function returns NULL.

Player.java
  What purpose does this Player DAO serve?
    This allows us to use object oriented design on the monopoly database, since
    the players are now objects.
  How does it compare with the Player table?
    Player is an object so it is object oriented, whereas Player table isn't.
